This Repo contains all the files used to predict, in real time, weather and temperature from IoT Environment sensors. The Data that was provided by Dot and Marco in JSON is included as well as the file that has the relevant extracted fields. 

The extraction was done using an ETL tool called "Talend". It is an open source data management tool that can be found here:

https://www.talend.com/download <- I recommend downloading the "Data Integration Tool"

Once the fields of interest were determined and extracted, the file was exported to Excel whereby a basic vizual check was made and then exported to .csv

The rest of the analysis was done using the R programming Language, another Open Source tool that can be found here:

I use RStudio which is an editor and console in one. It makes workflow and management of packages a lot easier than just the console.

Please, get in touch with any questions about my work and thought process
